Certainly, here's a detailed description of the code:

1. The code imports necessary libraries: Pandas for data manipulation, re for regular expressions, Matplotlib for data visualization, and the VADER sentiment analysis library from NLTK.

2. The dataset is loaded from a CSV file named "social_media_data.csv" and assigned to the 'data' variable.

3. The 'text' column from the dataset is extracted and assigned to the 'tweets' variable.

4. A function called 'remove_ats' is defined to remove '@' mentions (usernames) from the tweets.

5. The 'remove_ats' function is applied to each tweet in the 'tweets' variable, and the resulting list of tweets without '@' mentions is stored in the 'tweets_without_at' variable.

6. The VADER sentiment analyzer is initialized, and a list called 'sentiments' is created to hold the sentiment scores for each tweet.

7. A loop iterates through the 'tweets_without_at' list, calculates the sentiment score for each tweet using the VADER analyzer, and appends the compound sentiment score to the 'sentiments' list.

8. The 'sentiment' column is added to the original 'data' DataFrame, containing the sentiment scores for each tweet.

9. If the dataset contains a 'tweet_created' column with timestamp information, the code converts the column to datetime objects and sets the index of the DataFrame to the tweet timestamps.

10. The data is then resampled by hour, and the mean sentiment score for each hour is calculated and stored in the 'data_hourly' variable.

11. Finally, a line plot is created using Matplotlib, displaying the average sentiment score over time.

The key steps are:
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Removing '@' mentions from tweets
3. Calculating sentiment scores using VADER
4. Adding sentiment scores to the DataFrame
5. Resampling the data by hour and calculating the mean sentiment
6. Plotting the average sentiment score over time

This code performs sentiment analysis on a social media dataset, such as tweets, and visualizes the resulting sentiment scores over time.
